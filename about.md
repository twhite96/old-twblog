I have been programming as an autodidact and university student for three years. I attended the University of Pittsburgh for two years after a stint in a few junior colleges here in PA.

My toolbox contains JavaScript, React, some Rails, and CSS Grid and Flexbox.

Besides programming and writing for this blog, I enjoy photography, lifting weights when I can, and learning about AI, Machine Learning and tinkering with robots ðŸ¤–.
