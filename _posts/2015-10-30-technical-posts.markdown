I have neglected this site, blog page for **forever**. The reason was because I was getting a bit tired of forcing things to GitHub everytime I wanted to *do* something. Jekyll build. Jekyll serve. Git status, add, commit -m, *push*. It seemed to be a lot of work for a podcast site. I needed to get my podcast into iTunes, get a better host for my files, get another podcast player, etc. It, this Jekyll site, wasn't going to work well for that. So I let it languish.

But I fired it up again. I went to the url in Chrome and *missed* posting to it. I have a Code Newbie blog hosted on WordPress with a couple contributors. I kept trying to think of what I could use this site for.

So then I thought about it some more. I guess what I want to showcase here are technical posts that have nothing to do with my coding journey. I am trying to juggle both Code Newb in Pittsburgh with this site and I don't know how I am going to do that but I am going to try.

So....stick around. I've got more up my sleeve.
